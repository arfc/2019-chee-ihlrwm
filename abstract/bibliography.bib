	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled. However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators lack dynamic repository performance analysis due to the computational burden of high-fidelity hydrolgic contaminant transport models. The Cyder disposal environment and repository module was developed to fill this gap. It implements medium-fidelity hydrologic radionuclide transport models to support assessment appropriate for fuel cycle simulation in the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator.
Rapid modeling of hundreds of discrete waste packages in a geologic environment is enabled within this module by a suite of four closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized contaminant transport: a Degradation Rate model, a Mixed Cell model, a Lumped Parameter model, and a 1-D Permeable Porous Medium model. A summary of the Cyder module, its timestepping algorithm, and the mathematical models implemented within it are presented. Additionally, parametric demonstrations simulations performed with Cyder are presented and shown to demonstrate functional agreement with parametric simulations conducted in a standalone hydrologic transport model, the Clay Generic Disposal System Model developed by the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy.},

Significance
- Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled through the characteristics of spent fuel which vary among fuel cycles and impact repository design and performance
- Dynamic integration of generic disposal model with fuel cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering components in the context of fuel cycle options
- Most current tools treat waste disposal phase of fuel cycle analysis statically in post processing by reporting values such as mass, volumes, radiotoxicity, or heat production of accumulated SNF and high level waste. They fail to address the dynamic impact of the waste streams on the performance of the geologic disposal system.
 
Cyder
- Cyder provides medium fidelity models to conduct repository performance analysis on efficient timescales appropriate for fuel cycle analyses},

	abstract = {Many countries produce significant quantities of nuclear waste which will have to be permanently and safely placed in a repository. We develop a mixed integer program that determines where to place each waste package of a specific waste type in a given time period with the goal of minimizing heat load concentration within a repository. Operational constraints include: (1) heat load limitations, (2) location and time at which waste packages can be placed, and (3) the number of waste packages that must be placed based on type and time period. Although applicable to other settings, we use the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada as a case study. Each of the three objectives used for minimizing heat load concentration improves upon existing greedy and sequential filling methods. Existing filling methods give at least a 17 \% to an 873 \% higher, i.e., worse, heat load concentration in the repository with respect to these objectives than do optimal methods. Enhancements, i.e., symmetry reduction constraints, perturbations, and heuristics, increase the size of solvable problem instances. This research can be applied to any deep geologic repository planned for operation around the world with slight modifications to incorporate site-specific objectives and constraints.},

	abstract = {A combination of transient heat transfer analytical solutions for a finite line source, a 
series of point sources, and a series of parallel infinite line sources were combined with 
a quasi-steady-state multi-layered cylindrical solution to simulate the temperature 
response of a deep geologic radioactive waste repository with multi-layered natural and 
engineered barriers.  
This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers 
to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, 
salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint.
This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large 
number of alternative disposal options and design configurations.  More than 100
combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and 
surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the evolution of the engineered barrier design for the proposed Yucca Mountain disposal system. Initially, the underground facility used a fairly standard panel and drift layout excavated mostly by drilling and blasting. By 1993, the layout of the underground facility was changed to accommodate construction by a tunnel boring machine. Placement of the repository in unsaturated zone permitted an extended period without backﬁlling; placement of the waste package in an open drift permitted use of much larger, and thus hotter packages. Hence in 1994, the underground facility design switched from ﬂoor emplacement of waste in small, single walled stainless steel or nickel alloy containers to in-drift emplacement of waste in large, double-walled containers. By 2000, the outer layer was a high nickel alloy for corrosion resistance and the inner layer was stainless steel for structural strength. Use of large packages facilitated receipt and disposal of high volumes of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, in-drift package placement saved excavation costs. Options considered for in-drift emplacement included different heat loads and use of backﬁll. To avoid dripping on the package during the thermal period and the possibility of localized corrosion, titanium drip shields were added for the disposal drifts by 2000. In addition, a handling canister, sealed at the reactor to eliminate further handling of bare fuel assemblies, was evaluated and eventually adopted in 2006. Finally, staged development of the underground layout was adopted to more readily adjust to changes in waste forms and Congressional funding.},

	abstract = {A key challenge in fulfilling the U.S. federal government’s obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is in the transition of used nuclear fuel (UNF) storage away from at-reactor storage and to a consolidated interim storage facility (CISF). The default strategy (Standard Contract) for the U.S. Department of Energy is to use the oldest fuel first (OFF) allocation strategy, which would entail the federal government prioritizing UNF shipments based on fuel discharge date with the option to prioritize shutdown sites. This may not be the most cost-efficient model given the extensive amount of UNF already at reactor sites. Currently, there is no way to preemptively remove fuel from sites that may be close to shutdown or have a higher storage or potential storage cost. As wet storage pools at reactors continue to fill to capacity at operating reactors, the backlog of UNF shipments to the CISF places additional pressure on operators to expand at-reactor dry storage capacity, thus adding to total system costs.},
