The largest barriers facing nuclear waste management in the U.S. 
are the political and social obstacles towards siting a final 
waste repository. 
It has been shown that permanent underground disposal of nuclear 
waste provides excellent isolation from the human-inhabited 
environment \cite{rechard_evolution_2014}. 
Therefore, this work relies on the expectation that the chosen 
method of long term disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) will be 
a deep geologic repository and that a site will eventually be selected.
The long term goal is to use U.S. historical SNF inventory data 
\cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017} in various simulations that model 
different transfer and loading strategies for moving SNF from reactor 
sites to a final waste repository.  
These simulations will be performed using \textsc{Cyclus}, an \textit{agent-based} 
fuel cycle simulation framework. In \textsc{Cyclus}, each facility in 
the fuel cycle is modeled individually and they interact with one another 
as independent \textit{agents}. 
Therefore, the goal of this work is to develop a waste conditioning \textit{agent} 
and a waste repository \textit{agent} to provide \textsc{Cyclus} with the capabilities 
to run these simulations. 
The conditioning facility packages spent fuel assemblies into a waste 
canister that has user defined properties such as radius length and material 
thermal conductivity. 
The repository facility emplaces waste canisters by 
maximizing mass loading while remaining below the thermal 
limit of the host geologic media.
