\section{Abstract}
Implementation of a nuclear waste disposal plan and minimizing the cost of the 
nuclear fuel cycle are crucial to the future use of nuclear power 
\cite{massachusetts_institute_of_technology_future_2003}. 
If the U.S. nuclear industry does not find an effective and safe plan to manage 
the waste. The nuclear industry will continue facing political and social 
opposition which will affect the long term use of nuclear energy. 
In this work various nuclear waste repository loading strategies are 
studied to determine which strategy is most effective at maximizing 
mass loading in a repository while remaining below a safe thermal limit 
for various host geologies. 

Previous work towards the wicked problem of getting spent nuclear fuel from reactor 
sites to a final waste repository focuses on various waste acceptance strategies 
and how it impacts a list of interdependent factors. 
Nesbit et al found that economic expenditure is minimized by reducing the 
number of years spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is left at post shutdown reactor 
sites by using a strategy of prioritizing fuel removal by longest shutdown plant 
first \cite{nesbit_proposed_2015}. 
Johnson et al used a mixed integer program to minimize heat load concentration 
in the waste repository \cite{johnson_optimizing_2016}. 
Greenberg et al conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the trade-offs 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint \cite{greenberg_application_2012}. 
WMSA is conducting a holistic evaluation of the entire system to consolidate 
how each factor impacts the cost and safety, to determine the best 
way to implement the operation of moving SNF from reactor sites to the final 
waste repository\cite{nutt_waste_2015}. 

The scope of this work is limited to repository loading. 
Strategies used in the abovementioned previous work such as first-in-first-out, 
last-in-first-out fuel and other combination allocation strategies are used 
in simulations to determine how these strategies impact the repository size 
and spacings. 
This research contributes to the knowledge of how the waste acceptance 
strategies will impact the repository loading segment of the system since 
most of the current research is focused on the economic and transportation 
components of the problem. 

These simulations will be performed using \textsc{Cyclus}, an 
\textit{agent-based} fuel cycle simulation framework. 
In \textsc{Cyclus}, each facility in the fuel cycle is modeled individually 
and they interact with one another as independent \textit{agents}. 
The goal of this work is to develop a waste conditioning \textit{agent} 
and a waste repository \textit{agent} to provide \textsc{Cyclus} with 
the capabilities to run these simulations. 

For loading of a waste repository, this work implements two 
constraints: keeping under the thermal limit and minimizing repository size. 
Increasing spacing between waste canisters in a waste repository will reduce 
the risk of exceeding the thermal limit, however, a larger repository must be 
commissioned or less nuclear waste can be stored in a specific repository size. 
Therefore, the repository facility designed emplaces waste canisters by 
maximizing mass loading while remaining below the thermal limit of the 
host geologic media. The conditioning facility packages spent fuel assemblies 
into a waste canister that has user defined properties such as radius length 
and material thermal conductivity.
